I cloned the 2 repositories Smári created and shared on Slack. He had already coded the Get and Post functions, so I coded the Delete and Put (update) functions. I also added quite a bit to the frontend, which you can see on the link at the bottom of this file.

I haven't really added any comments to the code, but the functions I've created are quite similar to the ones Smári created, so hopefully you are able to read them :)

See the repository for the frontend code here: https://github.com/fruimundur/-m5g3-frontend
